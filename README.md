## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

My favorite day to day applications include instagram, tiktok, and sometimes X. 

Features I like on instagram and tiktok include: 
- bookmarking

With the bookmarking feature, it becomes a bit hectic to look for videos you've saved. I would like to improve on this feature by implementing a filtering system. It can be similar to how you are able to save videos on youtube - creating a playlist for the videos you are saving. however i would like to take it a step further than youtube, with implementing a search capability and a filtering system (category, date saved)

An app I am interested in creating an iPhone cleaner. My idea is much more extensive that a typical iPhone cleaner that just suggests photos and videos you should delete to make space on your device. I want to take it a step further and create an application that keeps track of your application downloads. With this, it keeps track of app usage frequency. It can be helpful because sometimes we download so many applications that we forget about. With the new technology on iPhones, applications can be on your device without being on your homescreen so you may even forget about it completely. Apps can be offloaded when theyre not used, but why not remove them all together to avoid the clutter. You can filter the application based on download date, last used, alphabetical order, and genre. 

Another application I would be interested in creating is a fitness application. One where you are able to calculate and store you macros to achieve your fitness goals. You can log meals and foods. You can generate workout splits and log your workouts. You can scan barcodes to enable logging your foods to be an easier process. 

Another application I am interested in creating is an ItemFinder. I originally intended for it to be a website, but I feel it can also function well as an application as it will be readily accesible at our fingertips. The application will peruse large department stores such as Target, Walmart, Bjs, Sam's Club, Costco, Lowes, Home Depot, Best Buy, PC Richards etc. You can search for items and it will list what stores sell the item, how much each store sells it for, if a store has the item on sale, which store near you has it in stock. It can make item searching and price matching easier. Additional features and stores can be added later on. 

## Notes

Overall, the development of the app was pretty straight forward. The only issue I ran in to was the loading of the application. It took a while to load.
